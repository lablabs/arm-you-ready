## Description

CLI tool for checking (primarily) ARM readiness of your Docker images.
This tool can help you asses your readiness for migration to nodes with different CPU architectures on your Kubernetes clusters. It's main purpose is to check your Deployments and determine whether the Docker images that you're using have a version built for the target architecture.
## Features

- checks deployments and prints out whether the images used have a version built for target CPU architecture

# Private repositories

Private repositories are currently not supported.
It is possible to authenticate against a private repo with Docker SDK ([example](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/sdk/examples/#pull-an-image-with-authentication)), but it is hard to distinguish when to use/not to use auth when running this tool against a cluster with mix of public/private repo(s).

Therefore you might encounter errors such as
```
Error response from daemon: Head "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/zlosim/zmq-fluent-bit/manifests/1.5.x-zmq": unauthorized: incorrect username or password
```
